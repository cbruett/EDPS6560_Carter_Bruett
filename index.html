            I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Life finds a way. You know what? It is beets. I've crashed into a beet truck. So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Yes, Yes, without the oops! My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard!
                <br>
                <br>
            Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance. You really think you can fly that thing? Must go faster. So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs.
                <br>
                <br>
            Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Eventually, you do plan to have dinosaurs on your dinosaur tour, right? Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking.
